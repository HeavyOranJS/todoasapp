# todoASAPP
Todoasapp is a project that was done in two days for an interview I had no idea I'm in for. On the moment of writing it, I had some experience with JS and ES5, but for the most part it was a learning experience.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
